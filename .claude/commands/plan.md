# Create Implementation Plan

Start in Plan Mode (Boris Cherny: "I start most sessions in Plan Mode until the plan is solid").

## Output Format
Create a detailed plan with:

1. **SUMMARY**: What are we building/changing? (2-3 sentences)
2. **ARCHITECTURE**: Key technical decisions
3. **PHASES**: Numbered implementation phases
4. **RISKS**: What could go wrong? Mitigations?
5. **QUALITY GATES**: Tests/checks for each phase
6. **TASKS**: Specific task breakdown

Write plan to `.loki/PLAN.md`

Do NOT implement - just plan.
