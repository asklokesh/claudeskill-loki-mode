# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch

Based on the architect's analysis, I know exactly what the fix should be. The `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` class needs to override `id_for_label()` to return `None`. Let me generate the patch based on the standard Django codebase structure:

```

+++ b/django/contrib/auth/forms.py

 class ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(forms.Field):
     widget = ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget
```
