# sympy__sympy-17655
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the issue description and architect's analysis, I have enough information to generate the patch. The issue is in `sympy/geometry/point.py` where the `Point` class has a `__mul__` method but lacks `__rmul__`, causing `scalar * Point` to fail. Let me generate the patch based on the standard sympy Point class structure.
