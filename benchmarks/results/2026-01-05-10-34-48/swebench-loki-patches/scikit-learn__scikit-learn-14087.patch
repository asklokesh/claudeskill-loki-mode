# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the issue description and traceback, I can generate the patch. The error occurs at lines 2193-2194 where `coefs_paths` is indexed with 4 dimensions (`coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]`) but when `refit=False`, the array structure is different.

Looking at the traceback and the code pattern, when `refit=False`, the coefficients are not collected per fold in the same way - the `coefs_paths` array has shape `(n_classes, n_Cs, n_features)` instead of `(n_classes, n_folds, n_Cs, n_features)`. The fix needs to handle this case by using the correct indexing.
