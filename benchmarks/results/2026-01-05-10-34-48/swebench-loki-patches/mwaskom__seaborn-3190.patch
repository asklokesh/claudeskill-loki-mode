# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the architect's analysis, I need to generate a patch for the mwaskom/seaborn repository. The issue is that boolean data should be treated as categorical/nominal rather than continuous. Let me create the patch based on the error traceback and analysis provided:

Wait, let me provide the patch in the exact format requested without markdown code blocks:
