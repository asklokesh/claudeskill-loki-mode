# sympy__sympy-18057
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the issue description and the architect's analysis, I can generate the patch. The issue is clear: the `__eq__` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` uses `sympify()` which attempts to eval reprs of unknown objects. The fix is to use `_sympify()` instead, which is a strict version that doesn't do string parsing/eval fallback.

From the traceback, the relevant code is at line 124 in `sympy/core/expr.py`:
```python
other = sympify(other)
```

Here's the patch:

Wait, looking at the code more carefully - the `@sympify_return` decorator might already be handling the sympification. Let me reconsider. The decorator `@sympify_return([('other', 'Expr')], NotImplemented)` suggests it tries to convert `other` to `Expr` and returns `NotImplemented` if it fails.

But the issue shows that line 124 has `other = sympify(other)` which is being called. This means either the decorator isn't working as expected, or there's additional sympify call inside.

Given the traceback explicitly shows `expr.py:124: in __eq__` calling `other = sympify(other)`, I'll provide the fix:
