# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the architect's analysis and my knowledge of Django's codebase structure, I can generate the patch for this issue. The fix involves changing `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` from `None` to `0o644` and updating the relevant documentation.

+File Uploads
+------------
+
+* The default value of :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` has changed from
+  ``None`` to ``0o644``. In previous versions, if ``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``
+  was not explicitly set, uploaded files could have different permissions
+  depending on their size and the upload handler used. Files smaller than
+  :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` used the system's standard umask,
+  while larger files that were written to a temporary file ended up with
+  ``0o600`` permissions due to Python's ``tempfile`` module.
+
+  To restore the previous behavior, set ``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None``.
