# django__django-16595
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Since this is a patch for the Django repository (not the current codebase), I need to generate the patch based on Django's known source code structure. Based on the issue description and the architect's analysis, I can generate the appropriate patch:

--- a/django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
+++ b/django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
@@ -247,6 +247,11 @@ class AlterField(FieldOperation):
                 ),
             ]
         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)
+        if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
+            operation
+        ):
+            return [operation]
+        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)

Wait, let me reconsider the structure. Looking at Django's typical reduce method pattern, I need to see where this fits. The issue says `AlterField.reduce` doesn't consider when operation is also an `AlterField`. Let me generate the correct patch:
