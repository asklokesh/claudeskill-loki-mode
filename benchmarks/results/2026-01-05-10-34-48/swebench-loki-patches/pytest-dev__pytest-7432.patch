# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the issue description, I need to generate a patch for the pytest repository. The issue clearly states the bug is in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. Let me analyze what the fix should be based on the issue description:

The problem is that when `--runxfail` is used, the skip location reporting shows `src/_pytest/skipping.py:238` instead of the test file location. This means there's likely an early return or different code path in `pytest_runtest_makereport` that runs when `--runxfail` is set, which doesn't properly handle skip markers.

Looking at the pytest source code pattern, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook likely has logic like:

```python
@hookimpl(hookwrapper=True)
def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
    outcome = yield
    rep = outcome.get_result()
    
    if item.config.option.runxfail:
        return  # This early return is likely the bug - it skips the skip location fix
    
    # ... code that properly sets skip location ...
```

The fix should ensure that skip location reporting is handled even when `--runxfail` is set. The `--runxfail` flag should only affect xfail behavior.

Here's the patch:
