# sphinx-doc__sphinx-7738
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on my knowledge of the Sphinx Napoleon extension and the bug description, I can generate the patch. The issue is in the `_escape_args_and_kwargs` function in `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py`. The function was escaping trailing underscores unnecessarily. In reStructuredText, trailing underscores in names like `hello_` don't need to be escaped when they appear in field names or definition terms.

Here is the patch:

         return r'\*\*' + name[2:]
     elif name[:1] == '*':
         return r'\*' + name[1:]
```

Wait, that's not quite right. Let me reconsider the actual bug. The issue is that trailing underscores ARE being escaped when they shouldn't be. Looking at the code flow:

The `_escape_args_and_kwargs` function escapes trailing underscores, but this is incorrect for attribute names in field lists because trailing underscores don't need escaping in that context (they're not creating hyperlinks).

Here's the correct patch:
