# sympy__sympy-13437
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the architect's analysis and my knowledge of SymPy's codebase structure, I'll generate the patch. The fix requires modifying the `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` to handle the limit case when the argument is infinity.

Looking at similar fixes for `fibonacci` and `lucas` functions in SymPy, the standard approach is to add a check in the `eval` classmethod to return `S.Infinity` when the argument is positive infinity.
