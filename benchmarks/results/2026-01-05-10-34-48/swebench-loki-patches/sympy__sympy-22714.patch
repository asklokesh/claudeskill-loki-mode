# sympy__sympy-22714
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on my analysis of the issue and the previous patch attempts, let me provide the correct fix. The issue is that when `evaluate=False` is set globally, the check for imaginary coordinates fails because `im(a)` returns an unevaluated expression that is truthy, or the `is_real` property returns `None` instead of `True` for real integers.

Looking at the error traceback pointing to line 153 in `sympy/geometry/point.py`, the fix needs to properly handle the case where coordinate properties can't be determined due to disabled evaluation.
