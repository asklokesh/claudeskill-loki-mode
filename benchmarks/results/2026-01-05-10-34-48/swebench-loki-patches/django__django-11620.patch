# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the architect's analysis, I need to generate a patch for the Django codebase. The issue is in `django/views/debug.py` around line 482 where `Resolver404` needs to be changed to `Http404`. Let me provide the patch based on the standard Django codebase structure:

```

         resolved = False
