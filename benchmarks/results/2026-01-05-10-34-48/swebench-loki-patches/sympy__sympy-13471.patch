# sympy__sympy-13471
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the architect's analysis, I can generate the patch. The issue is clear: Python 2 pickles contain hex strings with `L` suffix for long integers, and Python 3's `int()` cannot parse this. The fix is to strip the `L` suffix before conversion.
