# pylint-dev__pylint-7993
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the issue description and the architect's analysis, I need to generate a patch for the pylint repository. Since this is a well-known issue in pylint (the issue describes the exact location at `pylint/reporters/text.py:206`), I can create the patch based on the standard pylint codebase structure and the bug description.

The issue is that the regex `re.findall(r'\{(.+?)(:.*)?\}', template)` doesn't account for escaped braces (`{{` and `}}`). The fix should handle these escaped braces before extracting arguments.
