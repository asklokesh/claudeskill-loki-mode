# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the issue description and architect's analysis, I can generate the patch for this matplotlib bug. The issue is in `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` in the `format_cursor_data()` method. The fix needs to check if the norm is a `BoundaryNorm` and handle it specially since it's not invertible but has a `boundaries` attribute that can be used directly.
