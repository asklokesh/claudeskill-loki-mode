# mwaskom__seaborn-2848
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

The seaborn repository is not available locally. Based on the architect's analysis and my knowledge of seaborn 0.11.1, I can generate the patch. The issue is in the `PairGrid` class in `axisgrid.py` - when `hue_order` is specified with a subset of values, the data needs to be filtered before hue delegation to axes-level functions.
