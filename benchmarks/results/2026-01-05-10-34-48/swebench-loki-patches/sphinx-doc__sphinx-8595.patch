# sphinx-doc__sphinx-8595
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

This appears to be a task to generate a patch for the sphinx-doc/sphinx repository, but the repository doesn't exist in the current working directory. Based on the architect's analysis, I need to generate a patch for the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file around line 1023-1026.

Based on the analysis provided, the fix is to change `if not self.__all__:` to `if self.__all__ is None:` in the `get_object_members` method. Here is the patch:
