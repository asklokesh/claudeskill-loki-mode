# sympy__sympy-16503
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the architect's analysis and my knowledge of SymPy's pretty printing code, I can generate the patch. The issue is in the `_print_Sum` function where the baseline offset calculation uses `more` but should use a value that properly centers the summand.

The key insight from the analysis is:
- The return value is `return d, h + 2*more, lines, more`
- The `more` value for baseline adjustment needs to account for the actual centering of the summand
- For simple single-line expressions like `x`, the baseline should be at the center of the sigma symbol

```

Wait, I need to understand the actual structure better. Let me provide a patch based on the standard SymPy codebase structure for this issue. The problem is that when adding something to a Sum, the baseline of the result is incorrect because the summand's position relative to the sigma symbol isn't properly centered.
