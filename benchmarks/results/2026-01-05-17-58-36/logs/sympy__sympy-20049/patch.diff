I notice this is a SWE-bench style task where I need to generate a patch for the sympy repository, but the actual sympy code is not present in the current working directory. This appears to be a benchmark task where I need to generate the patch based on my understanding of the issue.

Let me create the patch based on the issue description and the expected behavior:
