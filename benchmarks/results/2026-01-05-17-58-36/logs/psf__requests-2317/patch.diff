Now I have all the information I need. Based on the architect's analysis and the code structure:

1. In v2.4.3, `builtin_str` was imported from `.compat` 
2. `to_native_string` would have been in utils (as seen in the modern version's backwards compatibility import)
3. The bug is that `builtin_str(method)` converts `b'GET'` to `"b'GET'"` instead of decoding it to `'GET'`
4. The fix is to replace `builtin_str(method)` with proper bytes handling using `to_native_string`

Based on typical requests v2.4.3 structure and the architect's guidance, here's the patch:
