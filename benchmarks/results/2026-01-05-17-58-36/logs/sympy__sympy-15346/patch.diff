Based on the architect's analysis, I need to generate a patch that swaps the order of TRmorrie and TR10i in the transformation pipeline. Since I cannot find the actual sympy repository in the current working directory, I'll generate the patch based on the standard sympy repository structure and the architect's analysis.
