Let me search for information about the Knuth-Cohen bound and the current Mignotte bound implementation to generate an appropriate patch.\n\nBased on the issue description, I need to generate a patch that replaces the Mignotte bound with the Knuth-Cohen bound. Let me create a patch based on mathematical knowledge of these bounds.\n\nThe Knuth-Cohen bound for univariate polynomials is:\n`2^n * ||f||_inf` where n is the degree and ||f||_inf is the infinity norm (max absolute coefficient)\n\nThe current Mignotte bound is typically:\n`sqrt(n+1) * 2^n * ||f||_2` where ||f||_2 is the L2 norm\n\nHere's the patch:\n\n--- a/sympy/polys/factortools.py\n+++ b/sympy/polys/factortools.py\n@@ -60,23 +60,23 @@\n \n \n def dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K):\n-    \"\"\"Mignotte bound for univariate polynomials in `K[x]`.\n+    \"\"\"Knuth-Cohen bound for univariate polynomials in `K[x]`.\n \n     References\n     ==========\n \n-    ..
