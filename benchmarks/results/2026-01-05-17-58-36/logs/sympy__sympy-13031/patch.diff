Based on the architect's analysis, I need to generate a patch that renames `SparseMatrix.col_join()` to `SparseMatrix._eval_col_join()` in the SymPy repository. Since I don't have access to the actual SymPy repository here, I'll generate the patch based on the architect's analysis and standard SymPy sparse matrix implementation patterns.
