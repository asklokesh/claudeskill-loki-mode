Based on the architect's analysis, I understand that this is a SWE-bench task for the Django repository. The issue is about the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` widget which needs to override the `id_for_label()` method to return `None` to prevent the label from having a `for` attribute.

Since this is a patch generation task for a Django repository that isn't present in the current working directory, I'll generate the patch based on the standard Django file structure and the fix described by the architect.
