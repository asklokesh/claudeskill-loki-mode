The issue states that when `refit=False`, there's an IndexError at line 2194 where the code tries to index `coefs_paths` with 4 dimensions but the array doesn't have that many dimensions.\n\nLooking at the error and the architect's analysis, when `refit=False`, the code doesn't refit on all the data, so `coefs_paths` has a different structure. The problem is in the lines around 2193-2194 where it tries to compute the mean of coefficients across folds.\n\nLet me generate the correct patch:\n\n--- a/sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py\n+++ b/sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py\n@@ -2187,12 +2187,17 @@\n             else:\n                 best_indices = np.argmax(scores, axis=1)\n \n                 if multi_class == 'multinomial':\n                     w = np.mean([coefs_paths[i, best_indices[i], :]\n                                  for i in range(len(folds))], axis=0)\n                 else:\n-                    w = np.mean([coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]\n-                                 for i in range(len(folds))], axis=0)\n+                    # When refit=False, coefs_paths has shape (n_classes, n_cs, n_features + 1)\n+                    # instead of (n_classes, n_folds, n_cs, n_features + 1)\n+                    if coefs_paths.ndim == 3:\n+                        w = coefs_paths[:, best_indices[0], :]\n+                    else:\n+                        w = np.mean([coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]\n+                                     for i in range(len(folds))], axis=0)\n \n                 best_indices_C = best_indices % len(self.Cs_)\n                 self.C_.append(self.Cs_[best_indices_C])",
