# sympy__sympy-14024
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

I need to work with the information provided. Let me analyze the issue based on the architect's analysis and generate the appropriate patch for the `sympy/core/power.py` file.

Based on the issue description:
1. When `a` is a symbolic positive integer, `(-a)**x * a**(-x)` simplifies to `(-1)**x` correctly
2. When `a = 2` (concrete value), the same expression simplifies to `(-1)**x` but gives wrong numerical results
3. The problem is in how `(-2)**(-10/3)` is evaluated - it doesn't respect the principal branch

The issue is in the `Pow.eval()` method where negative integer bases with fractional exponents are simplified. The fix should prevent incorrect simplification of expressions like `(-2)**(-10/3)` that don't preserve the principal branch.
