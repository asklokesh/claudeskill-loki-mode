# sympy__sympy-18189
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

This appears to be the claudeskill-loki-mode repository, not a sympy repository. The task is asking me to generate a patch for a sympy issue, but there's no sympy codebase here. Based on the architect's analysis, I need to generate a patch that adds `permute=permute` to a recursive call at line ~185 of `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py`.

Since I don't have access to the actual file, I'll generate the patch based on the architect's description. The fix is to modify the recursive call to include the `permute` parameter.
