# mwaskom__seaborn-2848
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the context, I understand this is a SWE-bench benchmark where I need to generate a patch for the seaborn issue mwaskom__seaborn-2848. The issue is about `pairplot` failing when `hue_order` doesn't contain all hue values.

Looking at the existing patch that was generated, I can see the format. However, I need to generate a clean patch without any explanatory text, just the raw unified diff format.

Based on the architect's analysis and the issue description:
- The bug is in `PairGrid` class in `seaborn/axisgrid.py`
- When `hue_order` is a subset of hue values, data should be filtered to only include rows where the hue column values are in `hue_order`
- This filtering should happen before hue delegation to axes-level functions
