# sympy__sympy-24066
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the issue description, this appears to be a SWE-bench task where I need to generate a patch for the sympy repository. The repository files are not in the current working directory. Let me generate the patch based on the architect's analysis and the standard structure of sympy's unit system.
