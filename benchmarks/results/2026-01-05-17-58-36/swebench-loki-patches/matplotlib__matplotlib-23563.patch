# matplotlib__matplotlib-23563
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the issue description, this appears to be a SWE-bench task where I need to create a patch for the matplotlib repository. The issue states the file is at `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py`. Since this is a patch generation task for matplotlib, I'll create the patch based on the architect's analysis.

The bug is that when `set_data_3d()` fails due to a broadcast error, `_verts3d` is never initialized, causing an `AttributeError` when `draw()` tries to access it. The fix is to initialize `_verts3d` in the `__init__` method of `Line3D`.
