# django__django-11049
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

The existing patch seems incomplete/malformed. Based on the issue description, I need to:

1. Find the DurationField error message that shows the format
2. Change `[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]` to `[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]`

Since I don't have access to the actual Django repository files in this directory, I need to generate the patch based on the standard Django structure. Let me create the correct patch based on the issue description and typical Django form field structure.

The issue states that the error message needs to be corrected. In Django's DurationField, the error message typically includes the format specification. Based on the issue description and Django's typical structure:
