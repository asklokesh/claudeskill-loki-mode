# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

This appears to be a benchmark task for generating a patch for a SymPy issue. Let me search for information about the Knuth-Cohen bound and the current Mignotte bound implementation to generate an appropriate patch.

Based on the issue description, I need to generate a patch that replaces the Mignotte bound with the Knuth-Cohen bound. Let me create a patch based on mathematical knowledge of these bounds.

The Knuth-Cohen bound for univariate polynomials is:
`2^n * ||f||_inf` where n is the degree and ||f||_inf is the infinity norm (max absolute coefficient)

The current Mignotte bound is typically:
`sqrt(n+1) * 2^n * ||f||_2` where ||f||_2 is the L2 norm

Here's the patch:
