# pytest-dev__pytest-7432
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the architect's analysis and the issue description, I can generate the patch. The bug is in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook which incorrectly overwrites skip locations for all skipped tests when `--runxfail` is active, instead of only affecting xfail-related skips.
