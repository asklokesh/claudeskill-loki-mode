# sympy__sympy-23191
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

The workspace is empty. Based on the context, I'm being asked to act as an ENGINEER AGENT to generate a patch for a sympy vector pretty printing bug. I need to create a patch based on the architect's analysis. Let me create the appropriate patch based on the understanding of the issue:

The issue is that unit vectors in sympy.vector objects are being inserted in the middle of expressions instead of at the end when using pretty_print. Based on typical sympy architecture, this is likely in the pretty printer's handling of vector objects.

Let me generate the patch:
