# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch

Based on the issue description and my understanding of the LogisticRegressionCV code, I need to analyze the problem. The issue states that when `refit=False`, there's an IndexError at line 2194 where the code tries to index `coefs_paths` with 4 dimensions but the array doesn't have that many dimensions.

Looking at the error and the architect's analysis, when `refit=False`, the code doesn't refit on all the data, so `coefs_paths` has a different structure. The problem is in the lines around 2193-2194 where it tries to compute the mean of coefficients across folds.

Let me generate the correct patch:
