# matplotlib__matplotlib-25079
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

I understand now. This is a benchmark environment for SWE-bench. The task is to generate a patch for a matplotlib bug. Based on the architect's analysis, I need to create a patch that fixes the issue where setting a norm after colorbar creation fails.

Let me analyze the problem:
- The issue is that in matplotlib 3.6.3, setting `plot.norm = LogNorm(vmin, vmax)` after creating a colorbar fails
- The error occurs in `colors.py` line 1694 with "Invalid vmin or vmax"
- The architect suggests the issue is with norm validation happening before autoscale updates limits

Based on the typical matplotlib codebase structure and the error traceback, the fix likely needs to handle the case where vmin/vmax might be None or need proper initialization when the norm is set. Let me generate the patch:
