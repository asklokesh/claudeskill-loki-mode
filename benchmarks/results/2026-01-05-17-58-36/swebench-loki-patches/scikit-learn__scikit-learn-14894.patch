# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch

Based on the issue description, I need to create a patch for the scikit-learn repository. The issue is in `sklearn/svm/base.py` around line 302 where there's a ZeroDivisionError when `dual_coef_indices` is empty. Let me create the appropriate patch based on the architect's analysis:
