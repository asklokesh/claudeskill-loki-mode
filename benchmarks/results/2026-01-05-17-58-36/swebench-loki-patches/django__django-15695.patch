# django__django-15695
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the existing patch that was attempted, I can see the approach. However, looking at the issue more carefully, the problem is that when `database_backwards` is called, it needs to rename FROM the new_name BACK to the old auto-generated name. But the current implementation tries to find the constraint by columns which may not work correctly. Let me generate the proper patch:
