# pytest-dev__pytest-5413
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

I see - this is a different repository. I'm being asked to generate a patch for the pytest repository, but I'm currently in the claudeskill-loki-mode repository. This is a task for an ENGINEER AGENT to work on a GitHub issue for pytest-dev/pytest.

Based on the architect's analysis, I need to generate a patch that removes the `ExceptionInfo.__str__()` method from `src/_pytest/_code/code.py` at lines 537-542. Let me generate the patch directly based on the information provided:
