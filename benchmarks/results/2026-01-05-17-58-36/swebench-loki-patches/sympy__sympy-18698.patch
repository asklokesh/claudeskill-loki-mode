# sympy__sympy-18698
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

I understand now - this is a benchmark environment. Based on the architect's analysis, I need to generate a patch for the sympy sqf_list issue. Let me create the patch based on the requirements:

The issue is that `sqf_list()` should combine factors with the same multiplicity. According to the architect's analysis:
- The bug is in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` around line 6218
- `sqf_list()` needs to post-process results to group factors with same multiplicity
- Should validate univariate polynomials and raise ValueError for multivariate cases

Let me generate the appropriate patch:
