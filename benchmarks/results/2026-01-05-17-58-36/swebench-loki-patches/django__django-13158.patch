# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the task description, I'm being asked to generate a patch for a Django issue. This appears to be a SWE-bench style task where I need to create a unified diff patch that fixes the QuerySet.none() bug with combined queries.

Let me create the patch based on the architect's analysis:

+            clone.query.set_empty()
+            return clone
+        
         clone = self._chain()
         clone.query.set_empty()
         return clone
