# django__django-14752
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the context, I understand this is a SWE-bench task where I need to generate a patch for a Django repository issue. The issue is about refactoring `AutocompleteJsonView` to support extra fields. However, the Django source code is not in the current repository - this appears to be a Loki Mode skill repository for running benchmarks.

For SWE-bench tasks, I need to generate the patch based on the issue description and architect's analysis. Let me create the patch for the Django `AutocompleteJsonView`:
