Now I have enough context. Based on the stack trace from the issue and the current code, I can see that:

1. The `generate()` function inside `iter_content()` (lines 816-837) already catches several exceptions like `ProtocolError`, `DecodeError`, `ReadTimeoutError`, and `SSLError`
2. However, it doesn't catch `socket.error` which can occur when reading from `self.raw.stream()` or `self.raw.read()`
3. The issue shows a `socket.error` bubbling up from the standard library during chunked reading

I need to add exception handling for `socket.error` in the `generate()` function. In Python 3, `socket.error` is an alias for `OSError`, but we should handle both for compatibility.
