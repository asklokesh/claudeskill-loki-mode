# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

I understand - this is asking me to generate a patch for a scikit-learn issue, but I'm working in the claudeskill-loki-mode repository which doesn't contain scikit-learn code. Since this is a task to generate a patch based on the architect's analysis, I should create the patch based on standard scikit-learn VotingClassifier implementation patterns.

Based on the issue description and architect's analysis, I need to create a patch that fixes the VotingClassifier to properly handle None estimators when sample_weight is passed to fit(). The fix should filter out None estimators before distributing sample weights.

Here's the patch:

+            fit_params = {name: sample_weight for name, est in self.estimators if est is not None}
         else:
             fit_params = {}
