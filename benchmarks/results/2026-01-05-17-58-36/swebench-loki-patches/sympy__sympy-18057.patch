# sympy__sympy-18057
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Now let me check what a more relevant patch looks like. Based on the issue description, I need to look for patches that modify `expr.py` or `sympify.py`. Let me create the patch directly based on the architect's analysis.

Based on the issue description and architect's analysis, I need to:
1. Modify `sympy/core/expr.py` to use `_sympify()` with `strict=True` in the `__eq__` method
2. Potentially modify `sympy/core/basic.py` if it has similar logic

Let me generate the patch:
