# matplotlib__matplotlib-23987
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the task description, I need to generate a patch for the matplotlib bug. The architect has identified that the issue is in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` around lines 2428-2431, where `subplots_adjust()` needs to check if the layout engine is enabled, not just present.

Since this is a patch generation task for a matplotlib issue, I'll create the patch based on the typical matplotlib codebase structure and the architect's analysis:
