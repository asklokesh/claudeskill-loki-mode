ISSUE:
Trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy text representation
When displaying a DatasetGroupBy in an interactive Python session, the first line of output contains a trailing whitespace. The first example in the documentation demonstrate this:

```pycon
>>> import xarray as xr, numpy as np
>>> ds = xr.Dataset(
...     {"foo": (("x", "y"), np.random.rand(4, 3))},
...     coords={"x": [10, 20, 30, 40], "letters": ("x", list("abba"))},
... )
>>> ds.groupby("letters")
DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' 
2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.
```

There is a trailing whitespace in the first line of output which is "DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' ". This can be seen more clearly by converting the object to a string (note the whitespace before `\n`):

```pycon
>>> str(ds.groupby("letters"))
"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'."
```


While this isn't a problem in itself, it causes an issue for us because we use flake8 in continuous integration to verify that our code is correctly formatted and we also have doctests that rely on DatasetGroupBy textual representation. Flake8 reports a violation on the trailing whitespaces in our docstrings. If we remove the trailing whitespaces, our doctests fail because the expected output doesn't match the actual output. So we have conflicting constraints coming from our tools which both seem reasonable. Trailing whitespaces are forbidden by flake8 because, among other reasons, they lead to noisy git diffs. Doctest want the expected output to be exactly the same as the actual output and considers a trailing whitespace to be a significant difference. We could configure flake8 to ignore this particular violation for the files in which we have these doctests, but this may cause other trailing whitespaces to creep in our code, which we don't want. Unfortunately it's not possible to just add `# NoQA` co

### Output

```
## Analysis

**Issue**: DatasetGroupBy's `__repr__` method produces trailing whitespace on the first line of output, causing conflicts between flake8 (which forbids trailing whitespace) and doctests (which require exact output matching).

**Root Cause**: The issue is in `xarray/core/groupby.py` around line 439 where the string representation is constructed, likely with an extra space before the newline character.

**Files Affected**:
- `xarray/core/groupby.py` - The `__repr__` method that generates the text representation
- `xarray/tests/test_groupby.py` - Tests at lines 391 and 408 that verify the current (incorrect) output

**Fix Strategy**: Remove the trailing whitespace from the string formatting in the `__repr__` method of the GroupBy class. Update the corresponding test assertions to expect output without trailing whitespace.

**Edge Cases**: Ensure the fix applies to both DatasetGroupBy and DataArrayGroupBy if they share the same `__repr__` implementation. Verify multi-line output formatting remains intact.

### Output

```
Based on the issue description and architect's analysis, I can generate the patch directly since the problem is well-defined. The issue is in the `__repr__` method around line 439 of `xarray/core/groupby.py` where there's trailing whitespace before the newline, and tests at lines 391 and 408 need updating.
