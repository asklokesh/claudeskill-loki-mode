### Prompt

You are the ARCHITECT AGENT analyzing a GitHub issue.

REPOSITORY: astropy/astropy
ISSUE:
Please support header rows in RestructuredText output
### Description

It would be great if the following would work:

```Python
>>> from astropy.table import QTable
>>> import astropy.units as u
>>> import sys
>>> tbl = QTable({'wave': [350,950]*u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2]*u.count})
>>> tbl.write(sys.stdout,  format="ascii.rst")
===== ========
 wave response
===== ========
350.0      0.7
950.0      1.2
===== ========
>>> tbl.write(sys.stdout,  format="ascii.fixed_width", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
|  wave | response |
|    nm |       ct |
| 350.0 |      0.7 |
| 950.0 |      1.2 |
>>> tbl.write(sys.stdout,  format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])

    return writer(data, *args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/astropy/io/ascii/connect.py", line 26, in io_write
    return write(table, filename, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/astropy/io/ascii/ui.py", line 856, in write
    writer = get_writer(Writer=Writer, fast_writer=fast_writer, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/astropy/io/ascii/ui.py", line 800, in get_writer
    writer = core._get_writer(Writer, fast_writer, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/astropy/io/ascii/core.py", line 1719, in _get_writer
    writer = Writer(**writer_kwargs)
TypeError: RST.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'header_rows'
```

RestructuredText output is a great way to fill autogenerated documentation with content, so having this flexible makes the life easier `:-)`

### Output

```
## Analysis

**Issue:** The RST (RestructuredText) writer class doesn't support the `header_rows` parameter, which allows displaying multiple header rows (e.g., column names and units). The FixedWidth format supports this, but RST throws a TypeError when the parameter is passed.

**Files affected:**
- `astropy/io/ascii/rst.py` - The RST class needs to accept and handle the `header_rows` parameter

**Fix strategy:** Modify the `RST.__init__()` method to accept the `header_rows` parameter and pass it to the parent FixedWidth class. The `write()` method also needs adjustment to properly format the RST table with header row separators when multiple header rows are present.

**Edge cases:** Need to ensure the RST table formatting (border lines with `===`) correctly handles multi-row headers, maintaining proper RestructuredText syntax for tables with unit rows.
