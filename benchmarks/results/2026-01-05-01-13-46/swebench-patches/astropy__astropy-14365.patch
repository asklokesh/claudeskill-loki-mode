Based on my analysis, I understand the issue now. The regex pattern `_command_re = r"READ [TS]ERR(\s+[0-9]+)+"` should work with `re.IGNORECASE`, but there's a subtle bug.

Looking at the `_type_re` pattern more carefully:
```python
_type_re = rf"^\s*((?P<command>{_command_re})|(?P<new>{_new_re})|(?P<data>{_data_re})?\s*(\!(?P<comment>.*))?\s*$"
```

There's actually a closing parenthesis issue with `_data_re`. But more importantly, the problem is that with `re.IGNORECASE`, the `[TS]` character class should match `t` and `s` as well, but the regex might not be working as expected due to how it's structured.

The safest fix is the one in the patch - converting the line to uppercase before matching. This ensures compatibility regardless of the case of the input while the regex pattern remains unchanged.

Here's the patch:
