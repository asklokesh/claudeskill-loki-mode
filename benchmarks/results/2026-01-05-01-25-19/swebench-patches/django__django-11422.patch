This is not the Django repository. I need to understand the issue from the description and provide a patch. Based on the issue description and hints:

1. The regression was introduced in commit `c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca`
2. The issue is in `iter_modules_and_files` in `django/utils/autoreload.py`
3. The `__main__` module (manage.py) has `__spec__` set to `None`, so it gets skipped
4. The fix needs to add special handling for `__main__` module

Let me construct the patch based on my understanding of Django's autoreload code. The key issue is that when checking modules, the code skips modules where `__spec__` is None, but `__main__` module always has `__spec__` as None even though it has a valid `__file__` attribute.
