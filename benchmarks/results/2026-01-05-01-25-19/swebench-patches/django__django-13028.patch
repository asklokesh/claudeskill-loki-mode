This appears to be a Django issue that needs to be fixed in the Django repository itself. Based on the problem statement and the hint provided, I can generate the patch directly. The issue is in the `check_filterable` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` around line 1124-1131.

The fix is to check if the expression is actually an Expression object (has `resolve_expression`) before checking the `filterable` attribute, because model instances might have a field named `filterable` that could accidentally trigger the `NotSupportedError`.
