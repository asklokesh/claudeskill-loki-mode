Based on my knowledge of Django's codebase and the issue description, I can provide the fix for this inconsistency. The issue is in `django/db/models/deletion.py` in the `Collector.delete()` method.

When QuerySet.delete() is called on a model without foreign keys and there are zero objects to delete, the code still adds an entry to the deleted_counter dictionary with a count of 0. However, when the model has foreign keys, the dictionary remains empty because the code path that adds entries only runs when there are actual objects to process.

The fix should ensure consistent behavior by not including model entries with zero counts in the result dictionary.
