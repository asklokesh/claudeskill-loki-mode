Based on the issue description and my knowledge of Django, I can construct the patch. The issue clearly states:

1. The `technical_404_response` function in `django/views/debug.py` performs URL resolving which can raise `Http404`
2. Currently only `Resolver404` is caught, but `Http404` should be caught as well
3. The fix is to catch `Http404` instead of just `Resolver404`

Looking at the referenced GitHub link in the issue (`https://github.com/django/django/blob/a8e492bc81fca829f5d270e2d57703c02e58701e/django/views/debug.py#L482`), the issue is that when `technical_404_response` tries to resolve the URL again to show debug info, it only catches `Resolver404`. If `Http404` is raised (like from a path converter's `to_python` method), it goes uncaught and causes a server error.

The `Resolver404` is actually a subclass of `Http404`, so catching `Http404` will catch both.

Here's the patch:

Wait, I need to understand the structure better. Let me reconsider based on the issue description and hints provided.

From the hints:
- "The technical_404_response view performs a new URL resolving which will obviously raise a new Http404 which won't be caught as only Resolver404 is checked"
- "The solution seems to be to catch Http404 instead of Resolver404 in technical_404_response"

The key insight is that around line 482, there's a `try/except` block that catches `Resolver404`, but when `Http404` is raised from a path converter, it's not caught. Since `Resolver404` is a subclass of `Http404`, changing the except clause to catch `Http404` will handle both cases.
