It seems the Django repository is not in the current directory. Based on my knowledge of Django's codebase and the issue description, I can provide the patch. Let me construct the patch based on how Django's model validation works.

The issue is that `UniqueConstraint` fields are not validated to ensure they exist on the model, unlike `unique_together` which raises `models.E012`. The fix needs to:

1. Add validation in the model's `_check_constraints()` method (in `django/db/models/base.py`) to check that fields referenced in `UniqueConstraint` actually exist on the model.

Based on Django's standard structure and the hints in the issue (which mention using `cls._check_local_fields()` for UniqueConstraint's fields), here's the patch:
