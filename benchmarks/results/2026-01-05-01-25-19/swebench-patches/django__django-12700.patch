Based on the problem statement, I understand the issue. The `cleanse_setting` method in Django's `django/views/debug.py` only handles `dict` types but doesn't recursively process other iterables like lists and tuples. This means sensitive values inside nested lists are not being cleansed.

Let me provide the patch based on my knowledge of the Django codebase and the issue description:
