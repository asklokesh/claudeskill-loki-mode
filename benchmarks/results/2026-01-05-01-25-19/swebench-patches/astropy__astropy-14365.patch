Based on the GitHub issue and the patch file mentioned, I can understand the problem. The issue states that the QDP parser uses regex patterns that are case-sensitive, and the fix should make them case-insensitive. The issue mentions a patch was attached that fixes it.

Looking at the error message `ValueError: Unrecognized QDP line: read serr 1 2`, the regex pattern is not matching lowercase commands. The fix should add the `re.IGNORECASE` flag to the regex patterns.

Based on the issue description and standard astropy code structure, here is the patch that fixes the case sensitivity issue:
