Based on my knowledge of Django's codebase and the issue description, I can provide the patch. The issue references ticket #27995 and the documentation states that only specific operations are allowed on combined querysets.

In Django's `query.py`, the `distinct()` method needs to check if the query has a combinator (union/intersection/difference) and raise `NotSupportedError` if so. The pattern used is to check `self.query.combinator` and raise the error.

Here's the patch:
