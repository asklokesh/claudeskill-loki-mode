Based on the architect's analysis, I understand this is a SWE-bench task where I need to generate a patch for the Django repository. The issue is in the Django codebase (django/django repository), not in the current working directory. I need to generate a patch that fixes the `get_FOO_display()` method for inherited choices.

According to the analysis:
- The bug is in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` around line 766
- The issue is caused by a `hasattr` check that prevents child models from overriding the display method
- The fix is to remove or modify this check

Let me generate the patch based on the architect's analysis:
