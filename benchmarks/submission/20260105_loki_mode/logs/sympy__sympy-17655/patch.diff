I understand now. This is a Loki Mode repository for SWE-bench benchmarking. The user is asking me to act as an ENGINEER AGENT to generate a patch for a sympy issue. I need to generate the patch based on the issue description and architect's analysis provided.

Based on the issue and analysis, I need to create a patch that adds `__rmul__` method to the Point class in sympy. Let me generate the patch:
