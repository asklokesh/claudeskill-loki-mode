Based on my analysis of the issue description and Django's architecture, I can generate the patch. The problem is that when `MIGRATE` is set to `False`, Django should use `run_syncdb` to create tables directly from models, but currently it doesn't handle this properly. The fix involves modifying the database creation logic to temporarily set `MIGRATION_MODULES` to disable migrations when `MIGRATE` is False.
