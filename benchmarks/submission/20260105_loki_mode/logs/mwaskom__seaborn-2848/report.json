The issue is about `pairplot` failing when `hue_order` doesn't contain all hue values.\n\nLooking at the existing patch that was generated, I can see the format. However, I need to generate a clean patch without any explanatory text, just the raw unified diff format.\n\nBased on the architect's analysis and the issue description:\n- The bug is in `PairGrid` class in `seaborn/axisgrid.py`\n- When `hue_order` is a subset of hue values, data should be filtered to only include rows where the hue column values are in `hue_order`\n- This filtering should happen before hue delegation to axes-level functions\n\n--- a/seaborn/axisgrid.py\n+++ b/seaborn/axisgrid.py\n@@ -1287,6 +1287,11 @@ class PairGrid(Grid):\n         self._extract_legend_handles = True\n \n         self._hue_var = hue\n+\n+        # Filter data to only include rows with hue values in hue_order\n+        if hue is not None and hue_order is not None:\n+            data = data[data[hue].isin(hue_order)]\n+            self.data = data\n+\n         if hue is None:\n             self.hue_names = None\n             self.hue_vals = None",
