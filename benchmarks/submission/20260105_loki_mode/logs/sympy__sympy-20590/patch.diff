Based on the architect's analysis, I understand this is a SWE-bench issue about Symbol instances gaining __dict__ in SymPy 1.7. The fix is to add `__slots__ = ()` to the DefaultPrinting class. Let me generate the proper patch based on the analysis provided.

According to the architect's analysis:
- The issue is in `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/printing/defaults.py`
- The fix is to add `__slots__ = ()` to the `DefaultPrinting` class
- This prevents slotted subclasses from getting a `__dict__`

Let me create the patch:
