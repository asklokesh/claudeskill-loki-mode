Based on my analysis of the existing patches and the issue description, I can now generate the proper patch. The issue shows that:

1. The vector `e.j` is being printed twice (duplicated)
2. The baseline alignment is incorrect

The fix needs to:
1. Properly separate the scalar coefficient from the basis vector
2. Ensure the basis vector is centered with respect to multiline scalar expressions
