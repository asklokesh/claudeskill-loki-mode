I see this is the Loki Mode repository, not the SymPy repository. The task is asking me to generate a patch for a SymPy issue. Let me create the patch based on the SymPy codebase structure and the bug analysis provided.

Based on the issue analysis, I need to create a patch for `sympy/core/power.py` to fix the inconsistent handling of negative bases with rational exponents.
