Based on the architect's analysis, I need to generate a patch for django/db/models/deletion.py. Since this is a SWE-bench task where I'm generating a patch for a Django repository issue, I'll create the patch based on the provided information about lines 276-281 and the need to mirror the behavior at lines 324-326.
