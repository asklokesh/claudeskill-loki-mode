Based on the issue description, this is a SWE-bench task where I need to generate a patch for a sympy repository issue. The repository files are not in this directory - I'm being asked to generate a patch based on the architect's analysis.

According to the issue and the architect's analysis:
- The bug is in `sympy/simplify/fu.py` at line 504
- The problem is `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` where `rv.exp` is `I` (imaginary unit)
- The fix is to check if the exponent is real before comparing

Let me generate the appropriate patch:
