This is a placeholder file. The actual task is to generate a patch for the sympy/sympy repository issue.

Based on the issue description and the architect's analysis, the bug is in the `col_insert()` method where `pos` is being incorrectly used in matrix slicing. Let me create the patch based on typical matrix insertion logic:
