Based on the issue description, I need to create a patch for the Django repository that adds the `prog` parameter to the `CommandParser` instantiation in the `ManagementUtility` class. Since I don't have direct access to the Django repository in the current workspace, I'll generate the patch based on the issue description and standard Django file structure.
