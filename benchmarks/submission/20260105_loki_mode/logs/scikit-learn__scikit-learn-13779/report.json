Since this is a task to generate a patch based on the architect's analysis, I should create the patch based on standard scikit-learn VotingClassifier implementation patterns.\n\nBased on the issue description and architect's analysis, I need to create a patch that fixes the VotingClassifier to properly handle None estimators when sample_weight is passed to fit(). The fix should filter out None estimators before distributing sample weights.\n\nHere's the patch:\n\n--- a/sklearn/ensemble/_voting.py\n+++ b/sklearn/ensemble/_voting.py\n@@ -93,7 +93,7 @@\n             )\n \n         if sample_weight is not None:\n-            fit_params = {name: sample_weight for name in names}\n+            fit_params = {name: sample_weight for name, est in self.estimators if est is not None}\n         else:\n             fit_params = {}",
