ISSUE:
`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints
Description
	
I hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.
Setting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers ​rollback emulation. In practice, for each database:
BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()
TransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)
(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)
serialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.
deserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:

## Analysis

**Bug:** `TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails when restoring objects with foreign key dependencies. The `deserialize_db_from_string()` method saves objects without wrapping them in a transaction, causing integrity errors when FK-referencing objects are saved before their referenced objects.

**Files affected:**
- `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` (primary fix location)

**Fix strategy:** Wrap the deserialization loop in `deserialize_db_from_string()` with `transaction.atomic()` to ensure all objects are saved atomically. Additionally, should use `constraint_checks_disabled()` context manager (like `loaddata` does) to handle MySQL/InnoDB which doesn't defer constraint checks to end of transaction.

**Edge cases:** MySQL/InnoDB requires explicit constraint check disabling; circular foreign key relationships must work; need to verify `check_constraints()` is called after restoration.

### Output

```
Based on the issue description and architect's analysis, I can generate the patch directly. The issue clearly describes the problem in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` and the fix needed is to wrap the deserialization in a transaction with constraint checks disabled, similar to how `loaddata` does it.
